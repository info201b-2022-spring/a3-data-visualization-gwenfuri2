         The issue of racial disparities in incarceration rates in the United States has been debated. We've all heard that individuals of color, particularly Black people, make up a disproportionately large number of the American jail population. This report examines the jail and prison population counts of black and white persons across the United States, using statistics collected by the Vera Institute of Justice to learn about the black-to-white imprisonment ratio and black individual incarceration counts.<br><br>

      This graph depicts the severity of the black-to-white incarceration ratio in the United States over the previous several decades. <br>
      Between 2006 and 2007, both have an identical number of incarcerations in the United States, but after 2010, the number of white incarcerations begins to exceed the number of black incarcerations.

        This graph is included to investigate an intriguing pattern in the total incarcerated black population across states. According to the figure, while California has the highest total number of incarcerated black individuals, this is not the case when comparing year to year. <br>
        Texas surpassed California in most of the following years after seeing a rise in 2015. <br>
        It's important looking into why there was a spike and whether Texas will become the state with the largest number of incarcerated black people.

  This map depicts the severity of the black-to-white incarceration ratio, which reflects the number of blacks incarcerated for every white incarcerated, <br><br> and is useful in assessing racism across states. New Jersey, Maryland, Louisiana, New York, Mississippi, and Illinois appear to have a greater rate (dark blue-purple), while the majority of states appear to have a low rate (light pink).<br><br> This suggests that black people in those states may commit more crimes, but also that racial disparities may be greater.

          The issue of racial disparities in incarceration rates in the United States has been debated.<br>
        We've all heard that individuals of color, particularly Black people, make up a disproportionately large number of the American jail population. <br>

        Louisiana has the greatest black-to-white incarceration ratio for both jail (2.26) and prison (3.17) populations, according to the data.<br>
        In addition, 11 states have a jail population ratio larger than 1.0, and 17 states have a prison population ratio greater than 1.0.<br>
        In terms of total incarcerated black people, "state highest black incarceration" California ranks #1 with the most black people incarcerated.<br>
        However, the number of black persons incarcerated has decreased.<br>
        According to the most recent data, jail incarceration decreased between 2008 and 2018, whereas prison incarceration decreased between 2006 and 2016.<br>

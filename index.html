         The issue of racial disparities in incarceration rates in the United States has been debated. We've all heard that individuals of color, particularly Black people, make up a disproportionately large number of the American jail population. This report examines the jail and prison population counts of black and white persons across the United States, using statistics collected by the Vera Institute of Justice to learn about the black-to-white imprisonment ratio and black individual incarceration counts.<br><br>

        Louisiana has the greatest black-to-white incarceration ratio for both jail (2.26) and prison (3.17) populations, according to the data.<br>
        In addition, 11 states have a jail population ratio larger than 1.0, and 17 states have a prison population ratio greater than 1.0.<br>
        In terms of total incarcerated black people, "state highest black incarceration" California ranks #1 with the most black people incarcerated.<br>
        However, the number of black persons incarcerated has decreased.<br>
        According to the most recent data, jail incarceration decreased between 2008 and 2018, whereas prison incarceration decreased between 2006 and 2016.<br>

          The issue of racial disparities in incarceration rates in the United States has been debated.<br>
        We've all heard that individuals of color, particularly Black people, make up a disproportionately large number of the American jail population. <br>
        This report examined the jail and prison population counts of black and white people across the United States, using statistics collected by the Vera Institute of Justice.<br>

        Louisiana has the greatest black-to-white incarceration ratio for both jail (2.26) and prison (3.17) populations, according to the data.<br>
        In addition, 11 states have a jail population ratio larger than 1.0, and 17 states have a prison population ratio greater than 1.0.<br>
        In terms of total incarcerated black people, "state highest black incarceration" California ranks #1 with the most black people incarcerated.<br>
        However, the number of black persons incarcerated has decreased.<br>
        According to the most recent data, jail incarceration decreased between 2008 and 2018, whereas prison incarceration decreased between 2006 and 2016.<br>
